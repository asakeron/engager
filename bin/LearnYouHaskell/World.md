Write a Haskell program that prints "Hello World" to the console (stdout).

## Tips
To make a Haskell program, create a file with the `.hs` extension. Your file
will have to define a `main` function. You can test your program with
`runhaskell` or `stack runhaskell`. For example:

    $ runghc MyProgram.hs

You can print things to the terminal using `putStrLn`:

    ghci> putStrLn "oh my god!"
